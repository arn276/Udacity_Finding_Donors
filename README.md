# Udacity_Finding_Donors
Supervised learning segment of Data Science Nano Degree

Description
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

Data Exploration

Student's implementation correctly calculates the following:
-- Number of records
-- Number of individuals with income >$50,000
-- Number of individuals with income <=$50,000
-- Percentage of individuals with income > $50,000

Data Preprocessing
-- Student correctly implements one-hot encoding for the feature and income data.

Question 1:
Naive Predictor Performance
--Student correctly calculates the benchmark score of the naive predictor for both accuracy and F1 scores.

Question 2:
Model Application
-- The pros and cons or application for each model is provided with reasonable justification why each model was chosen to be explored.
-- Please list all the references you use while listing out your pros and cons.

Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
-- Student successfully implements a pipeline in code that will train and predict on the supervised learning algorithm given.

Initial Model Evaluation
-- Student correctly implements three supervised learning models and produces a performance visualization.

Question 3:
Choosing the Best Model
-- Justification is provided for which model appears to be the best to use given computational cost, model performance, and the characteristics of the data.

Question 4:
-- Describing the Model in Layman's Terms
-- Student is able to clearly and concisely describe how the optimal model works in layman's terms to someone who is not familiar with machine learning nor has a technical background.

Model Tuning
-- The final model chosen is correctly tuned using grid search with at least one parameter using at least three settings. If the model does not need any parameter tuning it is explicitly stated with reasonable justification.

Question 5:
Final Model Evaluation
-- Student reports the accuracy and F1 score of the optimized, unoptimized, models correctly in the table provided. Student compares the final model results to previous results obtained.

Question 6:
Feature Relevance Observation
-- Student ranks five features which they believe to be the most relevant for predicting an individual'sâ€™ income. Discussion is provided for why these features were chosen.

Question 7:
Extracting Feature Importances
-- Student correctly implements a supervised learning model that makes use of the feature_importances_ attribute. Additionally, student discusses the differences or similarities between the features they considered relevant and the reported relevant features.

Question 8:
Effects of Feature Selection
-- Student analyzes the final model's performance when only the top 5 features are used and compares this performance to the optim
